This repo contains the implementation of EmpIRE algorithm for policy evaluation and optimal value function estimation. 

The code is split into two folders: algorithms/ contains the code necessary to run the algorithms and examples/ contains basic examples of how to use this repo as well as code to reproduce the results in the relevant paper.

The implementation is a joint effort of Eric Xia (ericzxia@berkeley.edu) and Koulik Khamaru (koulik@berkeley.edu).
